cPanel Application Installer Automation script 
=========

Ideally, this interacts with the Installatron Install Automation API, allowing installations of a user-specified application from a preset application library (e.g., WordPress, Drupal, phpBB, etc.) to the ''blog' sub-directory of the user's cPanel account. A randomized password is used for the newly installed application's `admin` login, and the account owner will be notified of their new login information via the email account provided during setup. Upon completion, this framework will be modular enough to handle installing a wider range of applications or multiple applications with minimal programming knowledge.



*Originally intended to serve faculty/staff and reduce service request queue related to basic WordPress/Drupal installation
